# PBRestimation
•	parallelTest_clustermq_....R is the «master code” that distributes the simulations onto many cores.
•	oneSimRun.R is the “submaster code” which calls the different functions for first simulating, then analyzing the data.
•	simulation_functions_myseed.R contains all the functions needed to simulate data.
•	analysis_functions_sep_robustvar_fix.R contains all the functions needed to analyze data.
